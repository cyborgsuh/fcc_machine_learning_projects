# FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning Projects

Explore my FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning Projects repository! This collection showcases my journey in the field of machine learning through projects completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

# Projects Included

## Rock-Paper-Scissors

Developed an algorithm to strategically beat specific players in the classic rock-paper-scissors game. Notably, defeating "Abbey" proved to be the most challenging opponent.

## Cat and Dog Image Classifier

Implemented a machine learning model to classify images as either cats or dogs. This project highlights image classification techniques in the context of computer vision.

## Book Recommendation Engine using KNN

Built a book recommendation system based on k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. Explored collaborative filtering to suggest books based on user input.

## Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator

Utilized linear regression to predict health insurance costs based on relevant factors. Explored the relationship between various features and the associated insurance costs.

## Neural Network SMS Text Classifier

Implemented a neural network to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). Explored the use of deep learning for natural language processing.
